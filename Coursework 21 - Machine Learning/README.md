Load the trained model [clf.pkl](https://github.com/DataNoob0723/Boot-Camp-HWs/raw/master/Coursework%2021%20-%20Machine%20Learning/model/clf.pkl) in the [model](https://github.com/DataNoob0723/Boot-Camp-HWs/tree/master/Coursework%2021%20-%20Machine%20Learning/model) folder to make predictions. No preprocessing on the input data to the trained model is needed. The trained model is able to achieve an prediction accuracy really close to 90%.
